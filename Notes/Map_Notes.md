# Map Notes 

## Next Time

* Goldenrod pier
  * Connect to goldenrod.
  * Map layout should go:    Route 47 <warp> Goldenrod Pier <edge connected to> Goldenrod City
  * warp between route 47 and pier allow for a pallette change
    * might not need "in-between" gate, just warp directly to the route (less work haha)
  * route 47 and everything west/north use JOHTO, while goldenrod uses JOHTO_MODERN for the radio tower
    * Also can't put warps on edge of map because goldenrod has the maximum number of warps already (15)
  * Maybe add some people on the pier
* Route 47
  * Improve the lighthouse, add an indoors, plus some people to talk to/battle
  * Add some swimmers outside to battle
  * Maybe a sandbar or two to get a few items, possibly hidden (the items)
  * Add some whirlpools

## Last Time

* Created route 47
  * Linked it to route 41
  * tried to link it to goldenrod, ran into issues with the pallette tiles not being swapped because they were connected without a warp
